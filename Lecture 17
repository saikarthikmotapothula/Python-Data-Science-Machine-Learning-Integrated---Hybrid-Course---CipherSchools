Data visualization is a way of presenting data in a visual format, such as charts, graphs, and maps. It helps data scientists to better understand and interpret complex data setsby making it easier
to identify patterns, trends, and outliers. This can be especially useful for communicating findings to others, as visuals are often more intuitive and easier to understand than raw data or 
statistical models .

5.Scatter Plot:Productivity vs hours worked 
6.Box Plot: Salaries by Department

2.It create a interactive graph 
3. It has wide range of chart 
4. It is cross platfrom support

It is used in two language :
-Python
-R

Principle of Data visulation :
-Principle 1 -> Clarity
1.Avoid clutter
2.Use clear visual hierachies 

-Principle 2 ->Accessibility
1.Use color scheme that are color blind friendly
2.Ensure text is readable

-Principle 3 -> Accuracy
1.Use appropriate scales and axes
2.Avoid misleading representationes

-Principle 4 ->Relevance 
1.Tailor visulations to the audience
2.Highlight what's most important 

-Principle 5 ->Aesthelics 
1.Balance color and design element 
2.Use whitespace effectively 

-Principle 6 ->Interaction
1.Example of interaction tools(eg: hover, drill-down)
2.Benefitd of interaction is exploring data

-Principle 70 -> Context
1. Keep the big picture in mind
